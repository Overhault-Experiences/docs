### Injection

The injection is an option which can be disabled or enabled, to toggle whether or not to initialize the eco executor when play testing.

### Debug mode

Self-explanatory, which, if toggled enabled, the plugin will warn about some security settings in the game settings if some settings are turned off and loadstring.

### Auto execute scripts

This option has 2: toggle it, or manage it. If the user enables the **Auto execute scripts**, any script that is an auto file will automatically be executed upon play testing the game. If the user wants to manage the auto files, it can be done by clicking manage on the option, then the user can import from file (**.lua**, **.luau**, **.txt** files only), or import from selection, export the auto file to the workspace (**Right-Click**), and delete the auto file (**Left-Click**).
