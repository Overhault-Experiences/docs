Eco Executor also has another alternative file system, except that the saving system doesn't use a **DataStoreService.**

## Save to FileStore

Saves the current editing code into the file store, naming the file if the first line in the editor has

```lua
--!nameFile FileName
```

<Note>
  The `FileName` is a placeholder name, change to whatever you like.
</Note>

## Import from FileStore

Opens a FileStore UI to view the files saved to import to.

## Delete file in FileStore

<Warning>
  Deletes a file in the FileStore.
</Warning>

## Overwriting a file in FileStore

There's one more comment directive when saving the file into the FileStore

```lua
--!overwriteFile FileName
```

When there is this code in the first line, it will find a file matching the `FileName` And when it does, it will overwrite the file content with the current one.
